# Django advanced report builder

A Django application that provides a fully featured, dynamic report-building interface. It allows users to create, customise, preview and export reports directly through a dedicated front-end UI, without writing queries or touching the Django admin.

## Features

- Build reports through a standalone report-builder interface (not the Django admin).
- Choose a root model and dynamically select fields to display.
- Add filters, conditions, ordering and grouping.
- Preview results instantly within the UI.
- Export to CSV, Excel and other supported formats.
- Pluggable architecture for adding formats, custom filters, or integration hooks.
- Designed to integrate easily into existing Django projects.
